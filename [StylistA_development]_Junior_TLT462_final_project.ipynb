        "  ## OVERVIEW\n",
        "\n",
        "Unlike existing grammar-correction driven applications such as Grammarly or Microsoft Office’s colored wavy underlines; my agent will focus on patterns and trends of textual samples. By training StylistA to understand patterns such as amount of words in a sentence, amount of (and type of) punctuation used, exaggerated use of certain parts of the speech (i.e., adjectives, adverbs, interjections), it will possible to output variations in stylistics (contrasted to academic manuscript exemplars), and assist students to improve their writing style by visually highlighting areas of the text that need to be improved.\n",
        "\n",
        "Selecting the most suitable model for a Machine Learning (ML) project is crucial. Since StylistA input is natural language, and its complexity layers, a more sophisticated method would be required to accomplish its goals of learning from a students' writing samples and being able to output a diagnostics report regarding its stylistics. Thus, StylistA will be run by a deep learning (DL) model; DL is a branch of ML where the model attempts to learn autonomously from input data received.\n",
        "\n",
        "The choice for not automatically correcting one’s textual input is intentional. StylistA is meant to be an education tool, to support students, teachers, and whoever seeks self-improvement and understanding of their own writing practices. If you are looking for an automatic, and oftentimes mindless, self-correction tool, you can stop reading this paper here. \n",
        "\n",
        "## METHOD\n",
        "\n",
        "I decided to conduct the  *[Plan B: TensorFlow (TF) and Keras](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1-v7RltnlpDyiyObd5d85aYfOuDxO1gks)* of my roadmap using Google Colaboratory (colab), a cloud programming notebook. With colab, data are easily structured, feed, analyzed, fit into models, optimized, and deployerd using TF and keras.  Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), a deep learning model, are known for being effective handling sequential data, ordered numbers, characters, and words. In addition, after the model is trained with a corpus (i.e., textual sample data files). Because it is a deep learning model, is able to create unique textual pieces based on its learning mechanisms within the hidden layers of its neural network.  \n",
        "\n",
        "RNN/LSTM is short for Recurrent Neural Networks that use Long Short Term Memory, this model allows you \"to train character-level language models based on multi-layer LSTM [nodes]\" (Karpathy, 2015). The most effective and reffered model for character handling is the one developed by Stanford Ph.D. student Andrej Karpathy, and shared in his Github ([@karpathy](https://github.com/karpathy/char-rnn)). LSTM addresses RNNs caveats. Hence, it is a potential model to handle StylistA data input.\n",
        "\n",
        " ### Searching for THE model\n",
        "\n",
        "I started by identifying the best model for the project I had proposed. My prospective dataframe will derive from [Oxford Dictionaries API ](developer.oxforddictionaries.com) , because it is a comprehensive and well-known dictionary worldwide. Then I searched for freely available data sets online (e.g., [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)) using the following keywords: `dictionary`, `language`, `linguistics`. I found some interesting linguistic datasets, but were not within the scope of StylistA's needs (e.g., some were partial datasets, others were informal or comical language). \n",
        "\n",
        " ### Preparing the data\n",
        "\n",
        "The data used will be composed of many application letters I have written since 2016. Attached are the two most recent samples  [2018-2019](https://drive.google.com/file/d/13SvR0YhAbAEBeZmRk78H8O-_rZ3RIUoM/view?usp=sharing) and [2019-2020](https://drive.google.com/file/d/13SvR0YhAbAEBeZmRk78H8O-_rZ3RIUoM/view?usp=sharing), already edited to serve as corpus, saved as .txt files. This data preparing process has been invaluable, for me, because I can identify the linguistic and stylistic patterns as I clean and organize the sentences in the new file format.\n",
